%% Flexible Body from Finite Element Data
% 
% Models a flexible body using a deflection model that relies on data
% imported from finite element software.  Body deflection is superimposed
% on rigid body motion.  The mass of the body can be assigned to the rigid
% body or distributed across each interface frame.

%% Diagram
%
% The following diagram shows the generic structure of the body represented
% by these blocks.  Each frame (represented by the triad) can move along 6
% degrees of freedom with respect to the rigid body.  The amount it moves
% is calculated using data supplied by finite element software and entered
% in the block mask.

%% Parameters, Tab |Mass|
%
% *Body Mass Distribution*
%
% * |Single| - Body mass and inertia is assigned to a single rigid body.  A
% minimal amount of mass and inertia is assigned to each interface frame to
% ensure there are no degenerate mass errors. 
%
% * |Per Interface Frame| - Body mass and inertia is distributed across the
% individual reference frames.  The distribution is defined by parameter
% *Properties* in group *Body Mass Per Interface Frame* which is exposed if
% this option is selected.
%
% These parameters are exposed if *Body Mass Distribution* is set to |Single| 
%
% * *Mass*: Mass of body
% * *Center of Mass*: Location of undeformed body center of mass
% * *Moments of Inertia*: Moments of inertia for undeformed body
% * *Products of Inertia*: Products of inertia for undeformed body
% * *Cube Side Length*: Determines minimum inertia at interface frame
% * *Cube Mass*: Minimum mass at interface frame
%
% These parameters are exposed if *Body Mass Distribution* is set to |Per
% Interface Frame|
%
% * *Properties* in group *Body Mass Per Interface Frame*
% Requires a structure array of length equal to the number of interface
% frames and with the following fields:
%
% # |offset|: 3-vector of translational offset of the rigid body
% piece's reference frame relative to the interface frame
% # |dim|: 3-vector of dimensions of the "brick" graphic to associate with the
% interface frame
% # |mass|: mass of the rigid body piece associated with the interface frame
% # |com|: 3-vector of center of mass
% # |moi|: 3-vector of moments of inertia
% # |poi|: 3-vector of products of inertia
%

%% Parameters, Tab |Geometry|
%
% *Rigid Body File Name*: String with name of geometry file for rigid body.
% Can be STL or STEP file.
%
% The following values can be defined for the rigid body solid, the
% interface solids, and the graphic representing the interface frame.
%
% *Color*: 3-vector with values between 0-1 defining color of rigid body solid [RGB]
%
% *Opacity*: Scalar value between 0-1 defining opacity
%

%% Parameters, Tab |Interface|
%
% *Rigid Body Frame*:  Index of interface frame to which the rigid body
% part of the subsystem is rigidly attached. Deformations are zero at that
% point since the rigid body serves as the reference with respect to which
% deformations are measured.
%
% *Interface Frame Locations*: Array of size n x 3, where n is the number
% of interface frames, containing the locations relative to the reference
% frame of the body in its undeformed configuration and with components
% resolved into that same frame. These coordinates must be consistent with
% the locations of the boundary nodes selected in the FEA software when
% generating the Craig-Bampton reduced model.
%

%% Parameters, Tab |Deformation|
%
% *Stiffness Matrix*: Reduced stiffness matrix obtained by transforming the
% full global stiffness matrix by the Craig-Bampton matrix. 
%
% *Mass Matrix*: Reduced mass matrix obtained by transforming the
% full global stiffness matrix by the Craig-Bampton matrix. 
%
% *Modal Damping Parameter*: Optional parameter used to calculate the
% damping matrix for the substructure. This must be a scalar non-negative
% number, or 0 if there is no damping in the substructure. If *Modal
% Damping Parameter* is positive, then the damping matrix for the
% substructure is calculated by the block using these steps:
% 
% # Perform a modal reduction to compute the free vibration modes and
% natural frequencies associated with the mass and stiffness matrices;
% # Form the damping matrix in the modal space;
% # Transform it back to the Craig-Bampton degree-of-freedom space so it
% can be used in conjunction with the provided mass and stiffness matrices.
%
% *Frame Dof Indices*: Array of size n x 6, where n is the number of
% interface frames, containing for each of frames F1 through Fn the 6
% indices for the 6 translational and rotational degrees-of-freedom
% corresponding to that boundary node in the dof vector associated with the
% reduced mass and stiffness matrices.
%
% *Filter Time Constant*: Time constant associated with filters that break
% algebraic loops due to direct feedthrough between the Simscape Multibody
% part of the flexible body subsystem and the Simulink state-space part of
% the subsystem. The time constant should be set low enough to be able to
% capture the frequencies present in the system. A value that is too high
% can also make the simulation numerically unstable. However, setting its
% value too low can negatively impact simulation performance, so it is
% important to try and balance these criteria.
%
% *C-B Transformation Matrix*: Optional parameter that can expand the
% output vector coming out of the state-space system to include additional
% outputs computed by recovering deformations at points other than the
% interface frames using the Craig-Bampton transformation matrix. If it is
% not provided, enter the empty matrix [].
%
% *C-B Transformation Matrix Indices for Logging*: Optional parameter that
% can select outputs computed by recovering deformations at points other
% than the interface frames using the Craig-Bampton transformation matrix.
% If it is not provided, enter the empty matrix [].
