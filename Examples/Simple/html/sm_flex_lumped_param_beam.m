%% Flexible Beam from Lumped Parameters
% 
% This example shows a cantilever beam modeled using the lumped parameter
% method.  In a simple test, transient simulation can be used to determine
% the static deflection of the beam due to gravity.  A force can also be
% applied to the tip of the beam.
% 
% The model is configured so that linearization techniques can be used to
% identify the natural frequencies of the beams at various modes.

%% Flexible Beam Subsystem (Lumped Parameter Method)
%
% The chain of flexible elements is automatically constructed using MATLAB
% commands.  The subsystem mask permits the user to specify the number of
% elements, material properties, and beam cross section.  The degrees of
% freedom for the flexible body can also be selected in the mask.  The body
% "Flex Joint" within the element can be replaced by another Simscape
% Multibody block that has the desired degrees of freedom.

%% Static Deflection
%
% In this model, the default values are for a 0.3m long beam
% constructed of aluminum (modulus of elasticity = 70 GPa, density = 2800
% kg/m^3). The beam is 0.015m wide and 0.005m thick.  For this test, we
% have increased gravity by a factor of 100 so that we can see the
% deflection.
%
% Euler-Bernoulli beam theory predicts the static deflection for a
% cantilever beam with one fixed end and one free end with equation (1)
% 
% $\delta={qL^4\over 8EI}\quad\quad\quad(1)$  
% 
% Where
%
% $q$ = Uniform load on the beam (force/unit length) 
% 
% $q  = rho*area*gravity$ 
% 
% = 2800*(0.015*0.005)*9.81*100/0.3 = 205.93 N/m
%
% $L$ = Length of the beam
%
% $E$ = Modulus of elasticity
%
% $I$ = Area moment of inertia of cross section
%
% The area moment of inertia for a rectangular cross section is: 
%
% $I = {(x_{width} \cdot x_{thickness}^3) / 12}\quad\quad\quad(2)$
%
% (0.015*0.005^3)/12 = 1.5625e-10 m^4
%
% Plugging these values into equation (1) yields
% 205.93*0.3^4/(8*70e9*1.5625e-10) = 0.0191 m
%
% Transient simulation results match theory quite well, especially as the
% number of elements increases.

%% Mode Calculation
%
% It is possible to calculate the natural frequencies of the modes and to
% plot the mode shapes using linearization.  The natural frequencies can be
% predicted using the theoretical equation:
%
% $\omega_{n} = \beta_{n} \cdot \sqrt{((EI/(\rho \cdot A)}/L^2$
%
% where $\beta_{n}$ is a set of coefficients that depend on beam boundary
% conditions and A is the cross-sectional area of the beam. For the
% boundary conditions in this model (fixed, free) $\beta_{n}$ = [3.52 22.0
% 61.7 121.0].  This yields theoretical natural frequencies for the first
% four modes of 44.92, 280.76, 787.43, and 1544.23 Hz.  The results from
% linearizing our beam model match theory quite closely.

%% Results from Simscape Logging: Set Damping Factor Using Measured Data
%
% The plot below compares the simulation results of the lumped parameter
% beam with a beam modeled using data exported from finite element
% software. This step was performed to set the damping factor, which is
% most reliably set using measured data.  The elastic damping factor in the
% lumped parameter model was tuned until the simulation results matched the
% results from the FE import beam model.  This process can be used on
% measured data taken directly from finite element software and
% measurements taken from hardware.

%% Results from Simscape Logging: Distributed Load
%
% This plot shows the vertical deflection of the beam tip when it is
% subject to a distributed load (Earth's gravity * 100). 
%
% The peaks are used to calculate the damping ratio. We obtained damping
% ratio by examining the rate of decay in the simulation results for the
% beam. Looking at successive peaks, we found the logarithmic decrement
% using the following formula:
%
% $\delta = 1/n \cdot ln(x(t)/x(t+nT))$
%
% The damping ratio can be found from the logarithmic decrement
%
% $\zeta = 1/\sqrt{1+(2\pi/\delta)^2}$
